## About:

ðŸŽ¯ Create a project that will expose a Restful API to a potential customer.

From a list of PokÃ©mon, the API allows you to perform CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete), it is also possible to return a page list.


ðŸ›  Technology and technique used:

- Ruby on rails 5
- TDD (Test Driven Development)

ðŸ“Œ The list of pokemon received in a CSV file has been imported into the Sqlite3 database for better future maintenance, such as a move to another database.

ðŸ“Œ  For testing TDD:
```ssh
    Test command: bundle exec rspec
```

ðŸ“Œ  For testing API:
```ssh
   -  Database configuration:
   rake db:migrate
   rake db:seed

   -  Run application:
   rails s
```
